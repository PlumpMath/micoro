1. Introduction

   micoro (for MIcro COROutine & MIke's COROtine) is a light weight, high
performance coroutine implementation.
   The basic idea of micoro come from the paper "Revisiting Coroutines"
(http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/docs/MCC15-04.pdf). As the paper proved,
the "full asymmetric coroutine" model is powerful, easier to use and 
expressive power equivalent to other similar models. So micoro is actually
a "full asymmetric coroutine" implemenation with simple API and clear 
semantics.
   The original motivation of micoro is to implement a light-weight 
cooperative multitasking infrastructure for server environment, so simple, 
performance and robust (rather than portability) is often the top 
considerations across disign. 


2. Requirement

   currently only x86 system is supported, and
   only GCC compatible compiler is supported.
